<p>This package defines common protos.</p>

<h2 id="WorkloadSelector">WorkloadSelector</h2>
<section>
<p>WorkloadSelector specifies the criteria used to determine if the Gateway
or Sidecar resource can be applied to a proxy. The matching criteria
includes the metadata associated with a proxy, workload info such as
labels attached to the pod/VM, or any other info that the proxy provides
to Istio during the initial handshake. If multiple conditions are
specified, all conditions need to match in order for the workload to be
selected. Currently, only label based selection mechanism is supported.</p>
