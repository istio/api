// includes the metadata associated with a proxy, workload info such as
// labels attached to the pod/VM, or any other info that the proxy provides
// to Istio during the initial handshake. If multiple conditions are
// specified, all conditions need to match in order for the workload to be
// selected. Currently, only label based selection mechanism is supported.
