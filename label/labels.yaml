  - name: security.istio.io/tlsMode
    featureStatus: Alpha
    description: Specifies the TLS mode supported by a sidecar proxy. Valid values are 'istio', 'disabled'.
      When injecting sidecars into Pods, the sidecar injector will set the value of this label to 'istio' indicating
      that the sidecar is capable of supporting mTLS. Clients injected with sidecar proxies will
      opportunistically use this label to determine whether or not to secure the traffic to this workload
      using Istio mutual TLS.

    featureStatus: Beta
    description: |-
      A label used to identify the network for one or more pods. This is used
      internally by Istio to group pods resident in the same L3 domain/network.
      Istio assumes that pods in the same network are directly reachable from
      one another. When pods are in different networks, an Istio Gateway
      (e.g. east-west gateway) is typically used to establish connectivity
      (with AUTO_PASSTHROUGH mode). This label can be applied to the following
      resources to help automate Istio's multi-network configuration.

      * Istio System Namespace: Applying this label to the system namespace
        establishes a default network for pods managed by the control plane.
        This is typically configured during control plane installation using an
        admin-specified value.

      * Pod: Applying this label to a pod allows overriding the default network
        on a per-pod basis. This is typically applied to the pod via webhook
        injection, but can also be manually specified on the pod by the service
        owner. The Istio installation in each cluster configures webhook injection
        using an admin-specified value.

      * Gateway Service: Applying this label to the Service for an Istio Gateway,
        indicates that Istio should use this service as the gateway for the
        network, when configuring cross-network traffic. Istio will configure
        pods residing outside of the network to access the Gateway service
        via `spec.externalIPs`, `status.loadBalancer.ingress[].ip`, or in the case
        of a NodePort service, the Node's address. The label is configured when
        installing the gateway (e.g. east-west gateway) and should match either
        the default network for the control plane (as specified by the Istio System
        Namespace label) or the network of the targeted pods.

  - name: topology.istio.io/cluster
    featureStatus: Alpha
    description: This label is applied to a workload internally that identifies the Kubernetes cluster containing
      the workload. The cluster ID is specified during Istio installation for each cluster via `values.global.multiCluster.clusterName`. 
      It should be noted that this is only used internally within Istio and is not an actual label on workload pods. 
      If a pod contains this label, it will be overridden by Istio internally with the cluster ID specified 
      during Istio installation. This label provides a way to select workloads by cluster when using 
      DestinationRules. For example, a service owner could create a DestinationRule containing a subset 
      per cluster and then use these subsets to control traffic flow to each cluster independently.
