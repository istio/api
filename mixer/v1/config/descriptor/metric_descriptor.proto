package istio.mixer.v1.config.descriptor;

// Defines a metric type and its schema.
//
// A metric is dimensioned by a set of labels whose values are derived at runtime from attributes.
// A given metric holds a unique value for potentially any combination of these dimensions.
//
// The following is an example descriptor for a metric capturing the number of RPCs served, dimensioned
// by the method being called and response code returned by the server:
//
//    metric_descriptor:
//      name: "response_code"
//      kind: COUNTER
//      value: I64
//      labels:
//        api_method: STRING
//        response_code: I64
//
// To actually report metrics at run time a mapping from attributes to a metric's labels must be provided.
// This is provided in the service's config; using our above descriptor we might describe the metric as:
//
//    metric:
//      descriptor: "response_code" # must match metric_descriptor.name
//      value: $requestCount        # Istio expression syntax for the attribute named "request_count"
//      labels:
//        # either the attribute named 'apiMethod' or the literal string 'unknown'; must eval to a string
//        api_method: $apiMethod | "unknown"
//        # either the attribute named 'responseCode' or the literal int64 500; must eval to an int64
//        response_code: $responseCode | 500
//
