# Istio APIs and Common Configuration Definitions

This repository defines component-level APIs and common configuration formats for the Istio
platform. These definitions are specified using the [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf)
syntax.

All other Istio repositories can take a dependency on the api
repository. This repository *will not* depend on any other repos

## Standard vocabulary

All components of an Istio installation operate on a shared vocabulary of attributes,
as defined in this repo.

## Updating
After [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) definitions are updated, corresponding`*pb.go`files must be generated by running `bazel build //...`. The files are generated in `bazel-genfiles` directory, in a subdirectory matching the directory of the defintion, e.g. `bazel-genfiles/proxy/v1/config`. The generated files must be copied to the directory of the updated profobuf defintions and committed together with the defintion changes.
