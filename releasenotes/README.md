This directory contains the release notes, upgrade notes, and security notes for Istio. Notes should be created as part of the pull request for any user facing changes. Before a release, the release notes utility will be run in order to generate a release notes file which will be reviewed by the release managers and documentation team.

For more information about the release notes tooling, please reference the
documentation in [Istio](https://github.com/istio/istio/tree/master/releasenotes)

Release notes should be created according to the [release notes template](https://github.com/istio/istio/blob/master/releasenotes/template.yaml)
