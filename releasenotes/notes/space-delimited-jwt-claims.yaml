    **Added** `spaceDelimitedClaims` field in `RequestAuthentication` under `spec.jwtRules.` to configure custom JWT claims
    that should be treated as space-delimited strings.
    This allows authorization policies to match individual values within space-separated claim strings,
    extending beyond the default `scope` and `permission` claims.
    This addresses compatibility issues when upgrading from older Istio versions with custom space-delimited JWT claim fields.
