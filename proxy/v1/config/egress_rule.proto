// Egress rules specify which domains outside of the mesh are allowed to be accessed by
// the microservices of the mesh. Currently, only two protocols are supported:
// HTTP and HTTPS. For HTTPS, the applications in the mesh will send HTTP requests to the
// appropriate port, e.g. GET http:/gmail.com:443. The Egress or the sidecar proxy will 
// perform TLS origination.
//
// An example rule - allow traffic to *cnn.com and *cnn.it domains that are not part of the mesh
//
// type: egress-rule
// spec:
//   name: cnn
//   domains:
//     - "*cnn.com"
//     - "*cnn.it"
//   ports:
//     - port: 80
//       protocol: http
//     - port: 443
//       protocol: https
//   use_egress_proxy: true
