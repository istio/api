// Egress rules describe the properties of a service outside Istio. When transparent proxying
// is used, egress rules signify a white listed set of domains that microserves in the mesh
// are allowed to access. A subset of routing rules and all destination policies can be applied
// on the service targeted by an egress rule. The destination of an egress rule is allowed to
// contain wildcards (e.g., *.foo.com). Currently, only HTTP-based services can be expressed
// through the egress rule. If TLS origination from the sidecar is desired, the protocol
// associated with the service port must be marked as HTTPS, and the service is expected to
// be accessed over HTTP (e.g., http://gmail.com:443). The sidecar will automatically upgrade
// the connection to TLS when initiating a connection with the external service.
//
// For example, the following egress rule describes the set of services hosted under the *.foo.com domain
//
//     kind: EgressRule
//     metadata:
//       name: foo-egress-rule
//     spec:
//       destination:
//         service: *.foo.com
//       ports:
//         - port: 80
//           protocol: http
//         - port: 443
//           protocol: https
