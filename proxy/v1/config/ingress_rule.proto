// Ingress rules are routing rules applied to the ingress proxy pool. The
// ingress proxes serve as the receiving edge proxy for the entire mesh, but
// can also be addressed from inside the mesh.  Each ingress rule defines a
// destination service and port. Rules that do not resolve to a service or a
// port in the mesh should be ignored.
//
// The routing rules for the destination service are applied at the ingress
// proxy. That means the routing rule match conditions are composed and its
// actions are enforced. The traffic splitting for the destination service is
// also effective.
