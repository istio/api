# Envoy Configuration APIs

This folder contains API definitions for istio/proxy Envoy extensions. Unlike other
APIs in this repo, these APIs are not subject to the rules in [GUIDELINES.md](../GUIDELINES.md)
and are treated as internal implementation details.

These API definitions are centralized in this repository to provide a single source of truth
with a small dependency footprint for ease of importing.
